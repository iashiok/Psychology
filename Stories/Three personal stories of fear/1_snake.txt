**The setup for the snake:
I was just a little boy about 5 years old, city-side raised in a large house with a big garden and I never seen a snake before.
A sunny day, my grandparents (at that time my grandfather was a medical doctor and grandmother an university secretary) took me along
with the car (a communist Lada during the peak of the communism) as they went to the country side where they had this hobby 
to "hoe-farm" some rented parcel of land: the socialist comrades were allowed to rent small plots of land to cultivate vegetables.
Everything was perfectly smooth, it was a regular occurrence - the day was hot, everything was perfectly green and there was a lake nearby.
On a similar occasion I had about a meters' worth of sewing yarn rolled on a pencil and a sewing pin to (in my mind) make an angling implement,
but I was small enough to not realize just my length worth of yarn and a pencil will not make it into a fishing rod that catches anything.

**The chase of the snake:
I snuck out of sight and through the tall maize forest (the maize plants were way taller than me) exploring the area and then I saw it.
It was a snake - still. So what I did was: yell. I yelled from the top of my lungs fixating the snake. I never looked away from it.
Help arrived within seconds, my grandfather identified the snake and hit it with the hoe until the snake died.
We left the scene and went to eat at the nearby peasants waiting for us.
As a note, during the actual several seconds stood perfectly still, I kept perfect eye contact and I was seeing the snake closer than it was.

**Epilogue of the snake:
The peasants we went to eat afterwards knew about the snake and it was a Șarpe de Casă - what is called word for word - "House Snake", in English
that would be "Grass Snake" (Natrix natrix).
Fast forward to today I am rather certain that we actually killed their snake and nobody said anything because of my grandfather status.
