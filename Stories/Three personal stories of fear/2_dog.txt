**The setup for the dog:
I was a big boy about 8 years old, city-side raised in a house with garden, I have seen friendly dogs before.
For some reasons I was let for a few weeks of holiday with some family friends on the country side.
Before leaving the place I switched hands and I got to a new country-side house where they let me at my own devices, unsupervised.
They were busy with packing and I was rather bored so I went to play with the dog.

**The chase of the dog:
I do not remember the actual playing part, but when it started barking I let him alone.

**Epilogue of the dog:
People were in awe, amazed that nothing happened. They held me a lecture on how bad that dog is and how dangerous and what it did to other people.
Luckily my grandfather wasn't around, but on the other hand, judging by the tales, the dog had it coming anyway. Was nice to me though, I did not yell.
