I will search for it more in my quest for knowledge and add a mark to prove or disprove the fact that a dog could use mirror neurons for training 
in the form of identifying the work that can be performed just by looking at the stage performance.
 
Until then - we can use this image and imagine that 
between the wolves there's a fence 
and that on their plates there are, on one side, beef steaks and bones and on the other side, boiled carrots 
and that the animals only see what food they get when the work is done 
and that it does not need both wolves to do the work, one being enough to pull its own plate
and that the work is much more intense than just pulling a chord,
and that after a while, the wolf that gets beef steaks simply works more and feeds the other wolf as well who just eats with no work.

article proving the fact that dogs do the social learning 
"Here, we investigated dogs’ ability to learn both from a dog and a human demonstrator in a manipulative task, 
where the models demonstrated which part of a box to manipulate in order to get a food reward." the answer is yes, see

Throughout each lifetime, [...wolves...] They assess the willingness of potential mates to join up in producing a litter, 
of potential rivals to escalate in protecting a mate, of group members in sharing a carcass, regurgitating, or stealing.

And I also found plenty of articles about inequity aversion in dogs 
https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13420-018-0338-x but for some reason I did not find a comparative study between inequity aversion in dogs
and inequity aversion in wolves. So yeah, piecemeal we can patch together the original article from parts or maybe try to reproduce it later.

So far I did not find an article that would study recognizable hallmarks of civilizations on animal cultures of which this experiment was truly part of
