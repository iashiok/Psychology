I will search for it more in my quest for knowledge and add a mark to prove or disprove the fact that a dog could use mirror neurons for training in the form of identifying the work that can be performed just by looking at the stage performance.
 
Until then - we can use this image and imagine that 
between the wolves there's a fence 
and that on their plates there are, on one side, beef steaks and bones and on the other side, boiled carrots 
and that the animals only see what food they get when the work is done 
and that it does not need both wolves to do the work, one being enough to pull its own plate
and that the work is much more intense than just pulling a chord,
and that after a while, the wolf that gets beef steaks simply works more and feeds the other wolf as well who just eats with no work.
